INSTALL
=======

There are two packages available, both contain source

      dome-4.80ar.02_win.zip  (Windows dome.exe executable, and source)
      dome-4.80ar.02.tar.gz   (source-only)

Windows users: unzip the package, optionally copy 'dome.exe' from the
top level directory to somewhere more convenient.

Everyone else: ...


BUILDING THE DOME PROGRAM FROM SOURCE
--------------------------------------


Unpack the source tarball. (Note: If using source from the git repository
there will be no configure script. The configure script can be created by
running 'autoreconf -v -i -W all'.)

In the top level directory, run

   ./configure
   make


After a successful build the 'dome' executable will be in the 'src'
directory. Copy it where you want it manually, or optionally install
it with

   make install

Please, let me know if there are any problems with the build.
