<H2>DOME 4.80ar.02</H2>

DOME is a program, by Rick Bono, for creating models of
geodesic domes, spheres and related models.
<P>
I have modified DOME 4.80 slightly to add support for OFF output, which
can then be processed and displayed by
<A HREF="http://www.antiprism.com">Antiprism</A>
and other packages
(but see also, the Antiprism
<A HREF="http://www.antiprism.com/programs/geodesic.html">geodesic</A>
program, which will make Class I, II, and III models based on general
polyhedra).

<P>
While I was looking at this I fixed some small problems I had getting
DOME to build. I converted the build to use the Autotools, which
will hopefully help with portability. I also made minor changes to the
POV-Ray output to make it compatible with the latest version of POV-Ray.
<P>
As the program no longer seems to have an official web page
I am making my changes available on this page.
<P>
I don't plan on making any further changes to the code, but I will
look at any problems with the build.

<H2>INSTALL</H2>

There are two packages available, both contain source

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="dome-4.80ar.02_win.zip">
    dome-4.80ar.02_win.zip</A> (Windows dome.exe executable and source)
<LI><A HREF="dome-4.80ar.02.tar.gz">
    dome-4.80ar.02.tar.gz</A> (source-only)
</UL>

Windows users: unzip the package, optionally copy 'dome.exe' from the
top level directory to somewhere more convenient.
<P>
Everyone else...
<P>

<H3>BUILDING THE DOME PROGRAM FROM SOURCE</H3>

Unpack the package file. In the top level directory, run
<PRE>
   ./configure
   make
</PRE>

After a successful build the <I>dome</I> executable will be in the <I>src</I>
directory. Copy it where you want it manually, or optionally install
it with
<PRE>
   make install
</PRE>

Please,
<A HREF="mailto:adrian@antiprism.com">let me know</A>
if there are any problems with the build.

<H2>README FILE</H2>

<PRE>
NOTE: This is a copy of DOME 4.80, 08/10/2002 with very minor modifications.

    Changes:       Changes to code to ease building on modern systems.
                   Changes to POV output for compatibility with latest POV-Ray.

Geodesic Dome Design
DOME
Version 4.80ar.02
16 March 2014

=============
What is DOME?
=============
DOME is a program which calculates the properties of a geodesic dome symmetry
triangle. DOME calculates spherical vertex coordinates, symmetry triangle topological
abundance, and chord factors. DOME supports class I (alternate) and class II (triacon)
breakdowns for Icosahedron, Octahedron and Tetrahedron polyhedron types. DOME also
supports "Buckyball" formations as well as elliptical geodesics and geodesic parabolic dishes. 

=============
Why DOME?    
=============
DOME began as a set of geodesic math test algorithims for use in investigating
properties of generalized geodesic structures. This continues to be the main purpose
of my development of the DOME code. DOME should serve as a basic tool for those interested 
in geodesic dome design and modeling. All source code is also included in this package
and is freely modifiable under the conditions of the GNU General Public License.
             
====================
System Requirements 
====================
Dome frequency is limited by the amount of memory available.

=========================================
Changes From Previous Release Version 4.6
=========================================
-Rewrote several functions into modules.
-Added Windows GUI front-end
-Upgraded VRML output to the VRML97 specification

======
Usage
======
DOME is run as a console application. The program will terminate with an error
message if there is not enough memory to allocate array space for the coordinate matrix.
If this occurs, re-run DOME and request a smaller subdivision frequency. Only even
frequencies are allowed when using class II.

Usage: dome [-fnnn] [-cn] [-px] [-s or -sb] [-en] [-v] [-w] [-h] [filename.xxx]<BR>

Where: -fnnn is geodesic frequency (default nnn=2)
       -cn is class type (n=1 or 2; default n=1)
       -px sets the polyhedron type
        where x is: i for icosahedron (default)
                    o for octahedron
                    t for tetrahedron
       -s  generate full sphere data (default: symmetry triangle)
       -sb generate a buckyball. Must use class I with frequency equal
           to a multiple of three.
       -en enable elliptical formation (default: n=1 circle)
           n=elliptical eccentricity (n &gt; 0.0 and n &lt; 2.0)
       -v  verbose data display at run-time
       -dn enables parabolid and specifies focus location
       -rn sets Outer radius of paraboloid.
       -w  enable wire-frame VRML or DXF output (default: face data)
       -h  displays a help screen
        filename.xxx is a standard DOS filename
        where xxx is: DXF, DAT, WRL, POV, PRN or OFF

=================
Examples of Usage
=================
-A 5 frequency, class I, icosahedron sphere in DXF format
 (note class I and icosa are the defaults): dome -f5 myfile.dxf
-A 3 frequency buckyball in POV format: dome -f3 -sb myfile.pov
-A 10 frequency, class II, octahedron symmetry triangle in DXF
 format: dome -f10 -c2  -po myfile.dxf

============
File Formats
============ 
DOME currently supports five file formats:
1.) DXF - DXF face data which can be input into most computer aided design packages.
    Each polyhedron face is saved on a seperate level if spherical data generation is
    requested.  DXF data for Buckyballs are saved as LINE data. The default DXF data for 
    all other structures is 3D POLYFACE data. This can be changed to LINE data with
    the -w option. Note that not all applications support DXF line data. In these cases,
    use polyface instead. 
2.) DAT - An ASCII report format. Shows only symmetry triangle parameters. This format
    displays chord factors, face angles and axial angles. Not available for Buckyballs.
3.) PRN - An ASCII comma delimited format. Contains vertex coordinate and chord
    coordinate data. Suitable for parsing into custom routines and spreadsheets. Only data 
    for the symmetry triangle is saved. Not available for Buckyballs.
4.) POV - POV-ray script file. Generates spheres for vertexia, cylinders for chords
    and triangles for faces. Faces are not saved when using the Buckyball option.
    The POV script consists of two files. The .POV file contains the scene description 
    while the dome.inc file contains the dome geometry. Note that DOME references "up"
    as the z-axis while POV references the y-axis. The Sky statement in the camera
    definition compensates for this. 
5.) WRL - VRML file for use with a VRML enabled browser such as the Cortona plugin
    from ParallelGraphics. Only wire-frame output is available with Buckyball option. 
    WinDome supports the VRML97 Specification.
6.) OFF - Can be processed, analysed and viewed by the Antiprism tools (use
    off_util to merge elements), Geomview and JavaView.


=====================
Elliptical Structures
=====================
DOME allows the creation of elliptical geodesic structures. The -en switch enables
this feature. The "n" parameter is the elliptical eccentricity. This value is simply
the ratio of the ellipse major axis to ellipse minor axis. A circle has an 
eccentricity of 1.0.

Dome allows eccentricity values greater than 0.0 but less than 2.0. An eccentricity
less than 1.0 results in an ellipse having a semimajor axis = 1.0 and aligned along
the x-axis. Likewise, an eccentricity greater than results in an ellipse having a
semiminor axis = 1.0 and major axis aligned along the z-axis.


====================
Parabolic Structures
====================
DOME now includes functions which allow the design of geodesic parabolic dishes. Two command line switches 
have been added to enable parabolics:

	-dn where n = the distance from the dish center to the focus.
	-rn Where n = the radius of the dish. This defaults to 2 x focus.

The parabolic functions work with:
1.) Class I or Class II geodesics
2.) All supported polyhedron types.

The following restrictions apply to the use of parabolics:

1.) A DXF filename must be included with the parabolic switches. 
2.) The -w wireframe option should not be used.
3.) The ratio of focal length to dish diameter (f/d) must be greater than or equal 0.25.
4.) No other output file type aside from the 3DFACE DXF file is supported at this time.
5.) Frequency is based on a spherical formation. Large values of f/d will reduce the number of 
    faces used in the structure. Compensate by further increasing the frequency.

DOME produces a DXF file containing the dish face data and an ASCII text file named parabolic.txt containing
the raw data for each face. The following data is output:

1.) Index data for each triangle vertex (A, B, C see map.gif)
2.) Chord lengths for each triangle side (a, b, c)
3.) Face angles (A, B, C).

This data is given for each polyhedron face. In the case of the class I icosahedron 20 faces will be output. The
class II structure will use up to 60 triangles. Many of these faces may not contain data as this is dependent
on the truncation used.

The enclosed file map.gif contains a graphical representation one polyhedron face as well as the nomenclature 
used for each triangle.

The units used for the focus location will determine the units of chord length. If -d6 is used where 6 is the
focal length in feet, then the chord lengths will be output in feet as well.

The parabolic.txt file is designed to be read by a spreadsheet application such as Microsoft Excel. When importing this
file into a spreadsheet, set the field delimiter to 'tab', the text delimiter to '"' and make sure that the first
three columns are read as text fields.

====================
Source Code Comments
====================
Releases of DOME prior to 4.0 had all the source code in one file.
DOME 4.80 has the source code split across several files:

	dome.txt      - this file
	Dome.cpp      - Source code for main program loop.
	Geodesic.h    - Header file containing variables, structures and class
                        member function prototypes.
	Geodesic.cpp  - Source code for geodesic class member functions. Most of
                        the work is done by these routines.
	Dxfsave.cpp   - Geodesic class DXF save routines.
	Povsave.cpp   - Geodesic class POV save routines.
	Wrlsave.cpp   - Geodesic class WRL (VRML) save routines.
	Offsave.cpp   - Geodesic class OFF save routines.
	Cartesian.cpp - cartesian and spherical coordinate conversion and data structures
        Cartesian.h   - header for cartesian.cpp
	Chords.cpp    - class containing chord data structures
        Chords.h      - header for chord.cpp
        Command.cpp   - class implementing input parameter data structures
        Command.h     - header for command.cpp
	Faces.cpp     - class containing triangle face data structures
        Faces.h       - header for faces.cpp	
	Labels.cpp    - class containing vertex label data structures
	Labels.h      - header for labels.cpp
	Points.cpp    - class containing vertex position data structures
	Points.h      - header for points.cpp
	ThetaTruncation.cpp	- class for collecting truncation data
	ThetaTruncation.h	- header for ThetaTruncation.cpp

=============
DOME Updates 
=============
This is some of the stuff I'd like to see in future versions of DOME and WinDome 

-Provide Buckyball topological abundance in reports
-Buckyball face data
-Dihedral Face Angles
-INI file input for customizing POV-ray and other settings.
